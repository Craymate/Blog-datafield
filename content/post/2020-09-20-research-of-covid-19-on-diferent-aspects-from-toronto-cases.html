<p>The dataset(covdat) is total reported cases of COVID-19 in Toronto</p>
<p>Episode Date is an estimate of symptom onset date in a case. It is calculated hierarchically based
on either the date of symptom onset, specimen collection/test date, or the date reported to
public health.</p>
<p>Reported Date is the date the case was reported to public health.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The major event in the year 2020 is surely the outbreak of COVID-19. It has significantly changed our life. In this paper, I will explore the influence of COVID-19 on different groups of people in Toronto. And also the effectiveness of the response of Government. This paper is mainly based on the confirmed cases` data from Toronto.</p>
<p>I mainly compared the data from each group of people such as male, female, resolved cases and fatal cases. Then I tried to find out the characteristics in each group and found out the possible reasons behind these data. The major found is that most fatal cases in the Toronto area are elder people, and this disease has indiscriminate influences across different genders.</p>
<p>First, I traced the curve of the outbreak from Jan 2020 until now and the distribution of cases on each age group in Toronto. Then I analyzed the sources of infections on these cases, and I trace the closed contacted cases curve to see if the policy is effective. In the end, I mainly focus on the fatal and resolved cases and tried to analyze the characteristics behind these two groups. In the future I will keep monitoring the cases in Toronto, seeing if there is another event worth analyzing. This paper`s weakness is that I omit lots of cases that the data related are not available so we cannot trace them, but there might be a major influence in these cases, which could significantly influence our conclusion. Also, the data sample is too small since we only have Toronto data.</p>

<h1><span style="color:purple">For Overall Cases:</span></h1>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/infect-month-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The peak is in April, and started to decrease in May. There was a boost from March to April. But now it has been back to the level in March.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/infect-age-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The infection between age groups is evenly distributed.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/source-plots-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are many cases that they are NA-Outbreak Associated, which means that we don`t know the source of infection on these cases.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/filtered-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The highest source of infection is close contact, which is significant higher than others.
And the second highest is the community.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/covdat-contact-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since April 1st, there was an emergency response from Ontario Government. But the close contact confirmed cases increases to the peak in May. Then this policy starts to take effect in June, and making significant effect in the following three months until now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full_contact &lt;- c(0,0,contact_case$count)
cor.test(full_contact, total_case$count)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation
## 
## data:  full_contact and total_case$count
## t = 4.9282, df = 7, p-value = 0.001698
## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.5229006 0.9747969
## sample estimates:
##       cor 
## 0.8810577</code></pre>
<p>Low P-value from result of cor.test() means total cases is related to close contact cases.
The sample estimates means that the total cases are estimated 88.1% related by closed contact cases.
This means social distancing is expected to be a right strategy on this outbreak.</p>
</div>
<div id="for-fatal-cases" class="section level1">
<h1><span style="color:red">For Fatal Cases:</span></h1>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/fata-age-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Most of cases are elder people. This is reasonable because they generally have weaker health conditions. As the age increases, the fatal cases also increase.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/fata-gender-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Gender seems have no influence on the fatal outcomes</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/fata-hosip-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Nearly half of fatal cases have ever hospitalized. And about 71% of total fatal cases got treated.</p>
</div>
<div id="for-resolved-cases" class="section level1">
<h1><span style="color:blue">For Resolved Cases:</span></h1>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/resol-age-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Younger people seems more likely to recover from this.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-research-of-covid-19-on-diferent-aspects-from-toronto-cases_files/figure-html/resol-hosip-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see that in most resolved cases, people can recover without even being hospitalized.
So immune system is making a great effect in this outbreak.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>COVID-19 is making no difference on different gender groups, but age groups. Elder people cases are more likely to be fatal based on Toronto data. And recovery of this disease is heavily based on immune system. Also, every age group could have equally chance to get infected.</p>
<p>Despite the unknown source of infection cases, the major source is close contact. The government published a law in April to enforce social distancing. This law is making its effect in June, and it is effective. The level of confirmed cases in Toronto in Sept shows the sign of increasing now.</p>
</div>
<div id="weakness" class="section level1">
<h1>Weakness</h1>
<p>In this paper, I omit the NA sources of infection, but it has the highest amount of infections, so this might be critical. Also, the data-set is too small to trace the real characteristics of COVID-19, since it only has data from Toronto. In the future, I will use a larger and well-specified data to further my study.</p>
<p>The data in this spreadsheet are subject to change as public health investigations into reported cases and continuous quality improvement initiatives are ongoing, and additional cases continue to be reported. The data will be completely refreshed and overwritten on a weekly basis.</p>
