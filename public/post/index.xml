      <description>AbstractWe wanted to investigate the social causes that could affect one’s outlook on life, especially during such a tumultuous time. In this paper we investigated general feelings about life, on a scale from 1 to 10, that Canadians harboured in 2017, particularly as it relates to key variables of interest which socially and culturally are considered to impact people’s outlooks—income, the number of children one has, and age. We found there is a definite positive relationship between income, age and number of children on one’s general outlook on life (though there were more peaks in the age variable, suggesting individual stages in life could affect outlook) through graphical representations of scatterplots and the construction of a linear regression model that took all three variables into consideration with the explanatory variable being the general outlook on life.</description>

      <description>Executive SummaryNearly all political action committees, city council members, political consultants, school board districts, government agencies, rely on offline or online surveys to get the insights they need to drive their causes and run quick polls on hot-button issues.
The importance of investigation is self-evident, and a good polling update of investigation must not only reflect the reality, but also help political parties adjust the focus of their campaign activities and achieve more election goals within a limited budget.</description>

      <description>AbstractIn this paper I will explore the data of COVID-19 cases from Toronto, and analyzing it in different aspects such as gender groups, age groups, fatal and resolved cases. Also, I will develop a model to pursue deeper influences from the variables and to know the level of influences by each variable. In the end, I found that age has the major influences on the outcomes ,and close contact is the major known source of infections.</description>
